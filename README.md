WebApp
======

An MVC Web Application framework.

******  DRAFT  *******

You need a web server, MySQL database and PHP (including php command line modules) installed.

To get this up and running (I know, I need to write documentation - it's on the todo list!) do the following:

1). download to the root directory of  web server;
2). Create a MySQL database (best to set character encoding to UTF-8)
3). update app/config/global.php:
- in the config array, enter the root directory of the app
- enter the settings to connect to a MySQL database into the db_config array - server IP address/localhost, username, password, database name. Note user must have read/write/create/drop privileges
3) Make sure all directories/files in the app can be written to by PHP, including .htaccess (this is likely to be ok as default)
4). go to a browser window and enter http://server_address/app_root_directory (e.g. http;//localhost/webapp/

If all goes well you should see a home page for the app.

To easily add new sections into the MVC structure:
1). open a command line prompt and change directory to the app root directory
2). enter php _system/section.php create section_name (where section_name is whatever you want to call your new section)

You should see a response that says the new section has been successfully created, followed by a procedure report. Otherwise the opposite - create section failed and a report of reversed items setting the App back to how it was before you tried to create the section.
You can delete sections by entering php _system/section.php delete new_section. Be warned, this will remove all section files and delete the database table - this action is irreversible!

Reloading the browser home page should now show a new section, that displays content text from its respective database table.

This is as far as automation goesâ€¦ now the App can be developed by editing the Model, View, Controller files, adding new fields into the database, altering main.css stylesheet (which needs reducing - on the todo list) etc...

To set a menu item as a list rather than a single link to a page, go to app/config/routes.json. In the same directory is routes.txt that details how to do this.
