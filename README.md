WebApp
======

******  DRAFT  *******

WebApp is a lightweight MVC Web Application framework for developers. It integrates a responsive interface using the Twitter Bootstrap code-base. Basic site sections cam easily be generated via the command line from which further development can then commence. It was originally developed for a museum online exhibition, but could be used for any site that conforms to a responsive approach.

The code-base is very much in its early stages of developemnt, and as such is relatively untested on different platforms. Please report any bugs experienced and contributions/thoughts welcome via the github development wiki.

Requirements:
Web server
MySQL database
PHP installed (including php command line modules).

Setup:

1). Clone to the root directory of a web server;
2). Create a MySQL database - set character encoding to UTF-8;
3). Update app/config/global.php:
- in the config array, enter the name of the root directory of the app
- in the db_config array, enter the settings to connect to a MySQL database - server IP address, username, password, database name. Note user must have read/write/create/drop privileges;
4). Make sure all directories/files in the app can be written to by PHP, including .htaccess;
5). Go to a browser window and enter http://server_address/app_root_directory (e.g. http;//localhost/webapp/

If all goes well you should see a home page for the app.

To easily add new sections into the MVC structure:
1). Open a command line prompt and change directory to the app root directory
2). Enter php _system/section.php create section_name (where section_name is whatever you want to call your new section)

You should see a response that says the new section has been successfully created, followed by a procedure report. Otherwise the opposite - create section failed and a report of reversed items setting the App back to how it was before you tried to create the section.
You can delete sections by entering php _system/section.php delete new_section. Be warned, this will remove all section files and delete the database table - this action is irreversible!

Reloading the browser home page should now show a new section, that displays content text from its respective database table.

This is as far as automation goesâ€¦ now the App can be developed by editing the Model, View, Controller files, adding new fields into the database, altering main.css stylesheet (which needs reducing - on the todo list) etc...

To set a menu item as a list rather than a single link to a page, go to app/config/routes.txt for instructions. In the same directory is routes.json that can be edited to do this.
